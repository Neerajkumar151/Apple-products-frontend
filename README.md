## � Introduction

This project is a detailed reconstruction of the Apple ecosystem's web interface. It goes beyond a simple visual copy by implementing core functional logic found in enterprise e-commerce platforms. From a global shopping cart system to complex routing and timeline-based animations, this application showcases the power of **React 19** and the **Vite** ecosystem.

## ✨ Core Features & Highlights

### 🛍️ Full E-Commerce Functionality
*   **Persistent Shopping Cart**: A robust `CartContext` system that persists via `localStorage`. Users can add items across different sessions without losing data.
*   **Smart Calculations**: Automatically calculates subtotal, variable tax rates (8.75%), and shipping thresholds dynamically.
*   **Product Variants**: Supports complex product variations (Colors, Storage sizes) with unique ID generation for cart items.

### 🎨 Cinematic UI/UX
*   **Performance Animations**: Utilizes **GSAP (GreenSock)** for high-performance, GPU-accelerated scroll animations and entrance effects.
*   **Glassmorphism**: extensive use of `backdrop-blur` and transparency effects to mimic the native Apple OS feel.
*   **Responsive Design System**: A fluid layout that adapts perfectly from large 4K displays down to mobile devices.

### 🧭 Deep Routing Architecture
*   **Comprehensive Sitemap**: Using **React Router v7**, the app covers the entire site map including:
    *   **Category Pages**: Mac, iPhone, iPad, Watch, Vision, TV & Home.
    *   **Support & Footer**: Dedicated pages for seamless navigation throughout the app.

## 🧠 How It Works

### The Cart Logic (`CartContext.tsx`)
The cart is the brain of the e-commerce features. It uses a custom hook `useCart()` to expose methods like `addToCart`, `removeFromCart`, and `updateQuantity`.
*   **Duplicate Detection**: When adding an item, it checks if a product with the exact same ID *and* variant (e.g., "iPhone 15 Pro - Blue - 256GB") already exists. If it does, it increments the quantity instead of creating a new entry.
*   **Financial Math**: `subtotal`, `tax`, and `orderTotal` are memoized values that recalculate instantly whenever the `items` array changes.

### The Navigation System
The `Navigation.tsx` component is more than just links.
1.  **Scroll Awareness**: It attaches a passive scroll listener to the window.
2.  **Visual Transformation**: As you scroll down (`scrollY > 50`), the navbar smoothly transitions its background opacity and blur using Tailwind utility classes controlled by React state.
3.  **Mobile Adaptive**: On mobile, it transforms into a hamburger menu with a slide-down animation.
